"""The Amazon Alexa integration.

This integration provides OAuth2-based connection to Amazon Alexa using
Home Assistant's built-in OAuth2 framework with custom PKCE implementation.

Features:
    - OAuth2 with PKCE (RFC 7636) for secure authentication
    - Automatic token refresh via framework
    - Multi-account support via unique Amazon user_id
    - Encrypted token storage
    - Automatic reauth flow on token expiry

Architecture:
    - config_flow.py: User setup flow using AbstractOAuth2FlowHandler
    - oauth.py: Custom AlexaOAuth2Implementation with PKCE support
    - __init__.py (this file): Entry setup and OAuth registration

Setup Flow:
    1. User initiates integration (Settings → Add Integration → Alexa)
    2. Config flow redirects to Amazon OAuth with PKCE
    3. User authorizes on Amazon's site
    4. Amazon redirects back with authorization code
    5. Framework exchanges code for tokens (using PKCE verifier)
    6. Config flow fetches user profile and creates ConfigEntry
    7. async_setup_entry registers OAuth implementation
    8. Framework handles token storage and refresh automatically

Token Lifecycle:
    - Tokens stored in Home Assistant's encrypted storage
    - Framework automatically refreshes before expiry
    - Reauth flow triggered if refresh fails
    - User notified via persistent notification

Example Config Entry Data:
    {
        "auth_implementation": "alexa",
        "token": {
            "access_token": "Atza|...",
            "refresh_token": "Atzr|...",
            "expires_in": 3600,
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "expires_at": 1699123456.789
        },
        "user_id": "amzn1.account.XXX",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
    }
