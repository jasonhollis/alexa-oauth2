# Alexa OAuth2 Integration for Home Assistant

Modernize your Alexa integration with secure OAuth2 authentication, automatic token refresh, and seamless YAML migration.

## 🔐 Why OAuth2?

Your current YAML-based Alexa integration stores credentials in plain text and requires manual re-authentication every 60 days. This integration replaces that with:

- **Secure OAuth2 (RFC 7636 PKCE)** - Encrypted token storage, no plain-text credentials
- **Automatic Token Refresh** - Never expires, seamless background refresh
- **Atomic YAML Migration** - Migrate from YAML to OAuth2 with zero data loss
- **Advanced Reauth Handling** - Handles edge cases (app revocation, secret rotation, regional changes)

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Home Assistant 2024.10 or later
- Amazon account with Alexa devices
- Home Assistant running with HTTPS configured

### Installation via HACS

1. **Add HACS Repository**:
   - Go to HACS → Integrations
   - Click "Explore & Download Repositories"
   - Search for "Alexa OAuth2"
   - Click "Install"

2. **Restart Home Assistant**:
   - Settings → Developer Tools → Restart

3. **Add Integration**:
   - Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations
   - Click "Create Integration"
   - Select "Alexa OAuth2"
   - Follow the OAuth2 flow (will redirect to Amazon login)

4. **Done!** Your Alexa devices are now available in Home Assistant with automatic token refresh.

## 🔄 Migrating from YAML

If you currently use the legacy YAML-based Alexa integration:

1. **The integration automatically detects** your existing YAML config
2. **Click "Migrate"** on the setup dialog
3. **Confirm** the device count matches your expectations
4. **Done!** Your devices are migrated with zero data loss

### What Happens During Migration?
- ✅ All device pairings preserved
- ✅ Custom device names preserved
- ✅ Preferences preserved
- ✅ Complete rollback available if needed (<2 minutes)
- ✅ Atomic transaction (all-or-nothing guarantee)

### After Migration
- Remove YAML config from `configuration.yaml`
- Restart Home Assistant
- Existing automations and scripts continue working

## 📚 Features

### Authentication
- RFC 7636 PKCE-compliant OAuth2 with Amazon LWA
- CSRF protection (256-bit state)
- Encrypted token storage (Fernet + PBKDF2)
- Automatic token refresh (every 60 seconds)

### Device Management
- Multi-account support (50+ concurrent accounts)
- Device pairing preservation during migration
- Custom device name preservation
- Three-way device reconciliation (YAML ↔ Alexa ↔ HA)

### Session Management
- Background token refresh task
- 5-minute refresh buffer (prevents expiry during API calls)
- Exponential backoff retry (1s → 16s)
- Single-flight pattern (prevents concurrent refresh storms)
- Graceful degradation (continue with stale token on failure)

### Advanced Reauth
Automatically handles:
- Refresh token expiry (60-90 day cycle)
- Revoked app (user removed app from Amazon)
- Client secret rotation (transparent handling)
- Regional endpoint changes (auto-detected)
- Scope changes (user declined permissions)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Basic Setup
No additional configuration needed! The integration handles everything:
1. OAuth2 setup (one-time)
2. Token management (automatic)
3. Device discovery (automatic)
4. Token refresh (automatic)

### Optional: Manual Token Refresh
Force token refresh without waiting (normally not needed):
```yaml
service: alexa_oauth2.refresh_token
data:
  entry_id: "YOUR_ENTRY_ID"
```

## 📊 Troubleshooting

### "Integration can't find my devices"
1. Verify Amazon account has Alexa devices
2. Check HTTPS is enabled in Home Assistant
3. Verify OAuth2 redirect URI matches (shown in config flow)
4. Check Home Assistant logs for errors

### "Token refresh is failing"
1. Check Amazon account is still active
2. Verify Alexa app still has Home Assistant permissions
3. Check internet connection
4. Check Home Assistant logs for specific error

### "Migration shows wrong device count"
1. Check Amazon Alexa app for actual device count
2. Some devices may be offline or unregistered
3. Account for device groups (count as 1 group)

### "I want to rollback from OAuth2 to YAML"
- Rollback available within 2 minutes of migration
- Click "Rollback" button on migration complete page
- Your original YAML config is restored
- Or manually restore from backup
